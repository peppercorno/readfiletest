# readfiletest
Testing out reading a local json file and html file, replacing part of the contents, and seeing the result on localhost.

As helped along by [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-web-server-in-node-js-with-the-http-module).

1. Save files here to a directory. 
2. In console, navigate to the directory. Run ```node app.js```. Local server will start running.
3. Go to your browser and check out http://localhost:8000.
